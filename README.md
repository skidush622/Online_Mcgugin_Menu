# Introduction


Currently, Mcgugin dining hall doesnâ€™t have an official page on the VU meal. So, as a resident at Blakemore, I think it is necessary to develop an application so that students who have dinner at Mcgugin can see the daily menu. First, I plan to have all the available food loaded into a database. Also, students can rate those food based on their preference. And for every day's food, it will be sorted based on rating of each food. Moreover, users can sign up/login and it is nice to have a recommended menu based on the preference of each user. We choose to create an Amazon Cognito user pool and use Amazon amplify for session-based authentication because Amazon amplify gives convenient functionalities such as login, signup, and signout.
